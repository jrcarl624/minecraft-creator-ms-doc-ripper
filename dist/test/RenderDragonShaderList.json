Exceptions are noted in the comments in the list of shaders below.","Each shader's first input is a base texture reference.","Each input's default value is shown, and used if an input is not defined under its associated shader's JSON identifier.","Comments explaining an input's use are not repeated if the input is used in the same operation under a different shader.","Each listed shader includes an example of a vanilla entity which uses that shader to get an idea of the entity's resulting on screen appearence and effects.","Input comments denoting \"accumulated result of previous operations\" include from the base-texture-input (and associated operation) down to that commented input. Often the only previous operation is to sample an entity's base texture."]},{"type":"heading","data":"Available Shader List"},{"type":"code","data":"entity:","language":"JSON"}]
