What this means is that particle effects are composed via a set of components.  In order for an effect to do something, you add a component that handles that aspect of the effect.  For example, an emitter usually needs to have rules for its lifetime, thus the effect should have one or more lifetime components that handle lifetime duties for the emitter and emitted particles."},{"type":"other","data":"The idea is that new components can be added later, and one can combine components (where it makes sense) to get different behaviors. A particle might have a Dynamic component for moving around, and a Collision component for handling interaction with the terrain, for example."},{"type":"other","data":"Think of components as telling the particle system what you want the emitter or particle to do, rather than exposing a list of particle parameters and having to wrangle those parameters to get the desired behavior."},{"type":"heading","data":"Curves"},{"type":"other","data":"Curves are interpolation values, with inputs from 0 to 1, and outputs based on the curve.

If the type is \"particle\", then the event will manually emit a particle on an emitter of \"effect\" type at the event location, creating the emitter if it doesn't already exist (be sure to use \"minecraft:emitter_rate_manual\" for the spawned emitter effect). \"particle_with_velocity\" will do the same as \"particle\" except the new particle will inherit the spawning particle's velocity."},{"type":"other","data":"Sound effects specify the specific \"level sound event\" to be played when the event fires."},{"type":"other","data":"The events themselves consist of an optional node tree and/or an actual event.
