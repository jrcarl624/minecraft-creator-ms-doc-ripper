Loading enforces one feature per file; the file name and the name of the feature must match. Feature names can include a namespace of the form \"namespace:feature_name\" to help distinguish them from features that may be in other behavior packs. This namespace is not considered when matching the filename to the feature name. For example, in a file called \"my_tree_feature.json\" both \"my_tree_feature\" and \"my_pack_name:my_tree_feature\" would be valid identifiers. If two behavior packs define the same feature name (including namespace), then the feature from the highest pack in the stack will be used.
