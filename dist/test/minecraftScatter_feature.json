Coordinates may be a single value, a random distribution, or molang expression that resolves to a numeric value. The `coordinate_eval_order` field is provided for finer control of coordinate resolution (particularly when using the `grid` distribution). `iterations` controls how many individual placements should occur if the `scatter_chance` check succeeds.
